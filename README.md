I abandoned this project and have now taken the same concept and applied it to creating my own ecommerce solution with postgres as backend. I was in the process of converting this app but really it just made more sense to create a new repo. What I've learned from this is that Js-buy-sdk is really bad and you should probably just avoid using it unless you hate yourself and want to spend your time creating workarounds for nonexistant functionality. Only the most trivial of stores could use this.
